# Indexed-Priority-Queue
A C++ Implementation of the Indexed priority queue/heap

As of October 2022, the code has been fully implemented and should be fully usable. If anyone would like to update the code, I have tried to comment every aspect of the class as much as possible, please feel free to pull request your changes!
